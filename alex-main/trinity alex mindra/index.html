                <p>We work with builders and homeowners to pre-wire a home during construction. It is very important to talk to the customer prior to discuss what their needs are. In many cases they choose to have wireless access points in the home for strong signal or certain points in the house for hardwired Internet. Structured panel is usually installed where all your wiring will go to. There are things that customers are not aware of until they talk to us because once the house is built it will be a challenge to run wiring in certain places especially on a two-story home.
